## Android Project Template
========================

My personal Android project template. Has basic gradle configuration
for adding some AndroidX libraries as well as having gradle wrapper ready to go.

The .gitignore has been modified to exclude IDE specific files and files that 
should be generated locally (e.g. local.properties).
